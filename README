This project implements a Simple Stateful Network File Server (SSNFS) using Sun RPC.
Clients interact with a remote virtual filesystem stored persistently on the server.
The RPC server maintains a stateful open file table in memory and a persistent filesystem on disk.

This design supports remote file creation, access, modification, and metadata listing while enforcing storage, user, and concurrency constraints.

System Design Summary
Feature                                     	Implementation
Virtual Disk                          	disk.dat (16 MB fixed file, 512-byte block size)
Blocks per File	                        64 blocks per file — fixed allocation
Max Users	                            10 users (home directory based on login name)
Max Files per User	                    10 files each
Max Open Files	                        20 open files system-wide
Persistence	                            disk.dat, files.dat, and pages.dat stored on server and reused after server restart
Directory Structure	Flat                no subdirectories, one home directory per user
Server State	                        Current open files tracked in memory (lost only if server crashes)

Files are allocated sequentially in blocks to simplify layout and access logic.

RPC Operations (Server-Side)

The server exports the following operations:

RPC Name	    Description
create_file	    Create a new file in user’s home directory
open_file	    Open an existing file, returns file descriptor
write_file	    Write data to an open file at current file offset
read_file	    Read from an open file at current file offset
seek_position	Random-access seek to given position
list_files	    List all files belonging to the user
delete_file	    Remove an existing file if not open
close_file	    Close an open file descriptor
